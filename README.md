### ⚔️ The Identity
I am a **3rd Year CSE Undergraduate** and an aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer**. 

Like a blacksmith forging steel, I am currently tempering my skills in the fires of algorithms and data. I do not seek to merely exist within the digital realm; I seek to alter its very fabric. My path is not one of maintenance, but of **creation**.

> *"I am searching for the spark that rivals the birth of the Internet—a revolution written in code."*

### 📜 The Creed of the Ronin
I walk the path of the **Independent Coder**. 

I build for the sake of the craft itself. I believe that true innovation comes from the freedom of open source and the unyielding will to build what *must* be built.

* **No Masters:** I code by will, not by wage.
* **The Goal:** To leave a dent in the universe, to create systems that outlive their creator.
* **The Method:** Deep research, relentless implementation, and radical transparency.
